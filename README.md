# OldSkuleBingo

Randomly generates a bingo card for this [OkdSkuleNerd](https://www.youtube.com/@OldSkuleNerd) reaction video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5KO__Mlpt8">VINTERSEA - At the Gloaming Void | HOT KARL BINGO and REACTION</a> (NSFW).  

The original video is a reaction to a music video by the heavy metal band Vintersea.  The host and guest discuss the game and what counts as a match.  The bingo squares are the host's creation and are explained in the video (at [1:09](https://youtu.be/r5KO__Mlpt8?t=69)-6:10).  I thought it would be fun for other viewers to be able to also participate in this game.

The user can click on the squares to mark the square (or unmark it).

The bingo card is hosted here: https://micahcochran.github.io/OldSkuleBingo/
